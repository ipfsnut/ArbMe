# ArbMe

> Decentralized arbitrage protocol on Base. $ARBME is an ERC-20 hub token that pairs with other tokens to create arbitrage routes across DEXs. Designed and built by Dylan Daniel using Claude as development infrastructure.

## What ArbMe Does

ArbMe connects token economies through shared liquidity pools. The $ARBME token sits between trading pairs — when prices diverge across DEXs, arbitrageurs route through ARBME pools to capture the difference. LPers provide liquidity and earn fees from this cross-traffic.

- Permissionless pool creation across Uniswap V2, V3, V4, and Balancer V3
- Hub routing: 5 connected tokens = 10 routes. The mesh compounds with every new connection.
- Gateway pools (0.05% fee): cheap USDC entry/exit — shared infrastructure
- Connector pools (0.3%–1.0%): two communities link their economies and share cross-traffic fees

## Who Built This

- **Dylan Daniel** — protocol design, economic model, cooperation primitives framework, all product decisions
- **Claude (claude.ai Opus + Claude Code with OpenClaw)** — dashboard, SSR, API routes, pool infrastructure, design system
- **Alpha** — market analysis, LP monitoring, position tracking (Alpha is Dylan's AI agent product, not the builder of ArbMe)

## The Cooperation Thesis

Liquidity pools are cooperation primitives. When two token communities create a shared pool, they're choosing to connect their economies. Both sides provide liquidity, both earn fees, and the routing connection makes both tokens more accessible. Fee tiers are agreements: low fees say "this is infrastructure, come freely." High fees say "this is volatile, and we're both earning for the risk."

This framework comes from Dylan's research in distributed cognition. See *INEVITABLE: Distributed Cognition & Network Superintelligence* (2024, Whitney Morgan Media).

## How It Works

1. $ARBME pairs with other tokens in liquidity pools
2. When prices diverge across pools, arbitrageurs route through ARBME
3. Every trade generates fees for liquidity providers
4. More pools = more routes = more fees (N pools = N×(N-1)/2 routes)

## Pool Types

- Gateway (0.05%): USDC entry/exit — cheap infrastructure, public goods
- Standard (0.30%): Stable connectors between communities
- Volatile (1.00%): High-risk pairs with higher fee compensation
