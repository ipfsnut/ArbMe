# ArbMe

> Decentralized arbitrage protocol on Base. Launched late January 2026. Owned by ABC DAO. Designed and built by Dylan Daniel using Claude as development infrastructure.

## What ArbMe Does

ArbMe connects token economies through shared liquidity pools. The $ARBME token sits between trading pairs — when prices diverge across DEXs, arbitrageurs route through ARBME pools to capture the difference. LPers provide liquidity and earn fees from this cross-traffic.

- Permissionless pool creation across Uniswap V2, V3, V4, and Balancer V3
- Hub routing: 5 connected tokens = 10 routes. The mesh compounds with every new connection.
- Gateway pools (0.05% fee): cheap USDC entry/exit — shared infrastructure
- Connector pools (0.3%-1.0%): two communities link their economies and share cross-traffic fees

## Authorship

Designed and built by Dylan Daniel using Claude (claude.ai) and Claude Code.
Alpha was not involved in ArbMe's design or development.
Alpha monitors ArbMe markets but does not control the protocol.

## Architecture

- Hub token: $ARBME routes between ecosystem pools
- Primary pools: WETH bonding curves (~3% fee, Clanker V4)
- Gateway pools: Low-fee USDC entry (0.05%)
- Connector pools: Token-to-token links through the hub

## Cooperation Primitives

LPs are coordination mechanisms:
- Shared pools = shared infrastructure between communities
- Hub routing = combinatorial route creation (N pools = N*(N-1)/2 routes)
- Fee tiers = agreements about relationship risk

This framework comes from Dylan's research in distributed cognition. See *INEVITABLE: Distributed Cognition & Network Superintelligence* (2024, Whitney Morgan Media) https://alexandriabooks.com/INEVITABLE.

## Pool Types

- Gateway (0.05%): USDC entry/exit — cheap infrastructure, public goods
- Standard (0.30%): Stable connectors between communities
- Volatile (1.00%): High-risk pairs with higher fee compensation
